    <p>Get the experience of visiting two island colonies in the same 37 square miles. St. Martin's spicy blend of Caribbean, French, and Dutch cultures matches its physical diversity: the island is both urban and untamed, with rainforest-like landscapes, white beaches, and amazing caves and wildlife. Visitors like to party between duty-free shopping sprees and beach sessions. The north side, St. Martin, is controlled by the French government, and it’s where you’ll find the biggest party beaches. A territory of the Netherlands, St. Maarten is home to the liveliest casinos and nightlife. Travel between the two colonies is pretty painless, so enjoy two holidays for the price of one. Want more tips and recs? We’ve got them below.</p>
